# images-as-2d-lists
An interactive team exercise made for year 9 GCSE students on the topics of storing images and Python 2D lists. Made as part of my teaching materials for the Communicating Computer Science in Schools module at Imperial College London.

## How to use

1. Download or clone these files onto your personal computer.
2. Open the file `setup.py` in Python IDLE (or another code editor) and run the program (it may take a while to complete).
3. If the program runs successfully, you can open the files `task1a.py`, `task1b.py` and complete the following exercises:
   1. For task 1(a): recreate this "bitmap" image ![image](images/task%201a%20image.png)
   2. For task 1(b): recreate this "bitmap" image ![image](images/task%201b%20image.png)
4. First try coding the exact pixel colour code, then try using nested for loops.
5. `task2.py` is a more fun open-ended task. Create your own image!
